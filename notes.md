# What I Did…

Read through the extant codebase to get a vibe.
Read the docs for URI.js
Install deps and run the tests
Stand up the API server and poke at the responses
Sketch out the shape of a diret and straightahead retreave fn
Note immediate concerns with the approach…
Fiddle with the pagination
Think about how to tell if its the last page…
Check for next page leading nodes
Wrestle with the weird recovery test
